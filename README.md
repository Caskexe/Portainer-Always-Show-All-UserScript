# **Portainer: Set Items Per Page to All** User Script
<img width="1277" height="654" alt="portainer" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70830af9-f6d7-4398-afad-4df49edc0f40" />

This User Script for Greasemonkey, Tampermonkey, or Violentmonkey automatically sets the "Items per page" option to **All** when you access your Portainer instance. It saves you time by bypassing the need to manually adjust this setting every time you load the page.

### **How It Works:**

Once the script is active, it will automatically adjust the "Items per page" dropdown to "All" on the Portainer dashboard. This is particularly useful for those managing large environments where the default pagination can be restrictive.

### **How to Use:**

1.  Install the script in your preferred userscript manager (Greasemonkey, Tampermonkey, or Violentmonkey).
    
2.  Set the correct Portainer URL(s) in the `@match` field (replace `192.168.0.___:9443` with your Portainer server address - if you have more than one Portainer location then you can duplicate the @match field for each.)

3. Once installed, refresh your Portainer dashboard, and the script will set the "Items per page" to **All** automatically.

### **Compatibility:**
- Works with Greasemonkey, Tampermonkey, and Violentmonkey.

Enjoy a streamlined experience managing your Portainer environment!
